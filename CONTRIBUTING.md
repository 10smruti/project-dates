# Contributing to project-dates

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## What should I know before I get started?
The repository is now in very basic state and would be primarily used to collect data about various places across the institute along with the their timings.
The information is stored in a JSON file. 
No prior experience with coding is required to contribute here and it is open to all. :sparkles: We happily welcome all first time contributors. :sparkles:

## Some Guidelines
* Do make sure you follow the json format and do not break the format. You can check the validity online at any sites like [JSONlint](https://jsonlint.com/)
* Consider usual working week while inputting the time. Consider weekdays(Mon-Fri) as working days and weekend(Sat, Sun) as holidays.
* Make sure to write details completely and do not use shortform.
* Make sure you increment the place_id in steps of one everytime a new data is entered.

## How to start?
* Fork the repository into your GitHub account.
* Create a new branch in your local repo
* Add changes into this new branch
* Commit changes and push to your GitHub
* Open the GitHub repo in browser and send a Pull Request

## Things to take care of
* Make sure that your master branch is in sync with the master branch of ours (Use git fetch upstream and git merge upstream/master)
* Make sure place_id is unique
